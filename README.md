# React Native Tabs Template

A starter template for building React Native apps with a tab-based navigation layout.

This project uses React Navigation's tab navigator as the foundation, making it ideal for quickly bootstrapping new mobile apps with a clean, minimal tab structure.

## ðŸš€ Features

- React Native app scaffolded with functional components
- Tab navigation already set up using `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`
- Organized file structure for easy extension

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayprox/react_native_tabs_template.git
cd react_native_tabs_template
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run on your device:

```

> **Note:** This template uses Expo for ease of development.

## ðŸ›  What You Should Customize

This is just a boilerplate to get your project off the ground. Here's what youâ€™ll want to update:

- **Tabs in `TabNavigator.js` or equivalent file**: Rename, add, or remove tabs depending on your appâ€™s needs.
- **Screens**: Replace the placeholder screens with your actual components.
- **`package.json`**:
  - Update the `name`, `version`, and `description`.
  - Add relevant dependencies your app needs.
- **App Metadata**:
  - Customize the app icon, splash screen, and other branding in the `app.json` (if using Expo).
- **Navigation structure**: Extend or replace with Stack or Drawer navigators as needed.
